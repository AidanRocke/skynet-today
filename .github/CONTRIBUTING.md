## Big Picture 
SkyNet Today is what it says it is - " Sane, informed criticism of the latest AI hype and doomsaying"

The idea is to get people with know-how in AI to write short, accessible pieces that give perspective about both AI hype and fear.  

 
## Format  
The format (right now) is to focus on a particular news story with each post. Each post have five parts: 

* The intro - a brief 1-2 sentence summary sort of deal. Eg " A truly astounding exemplar of how coverage of AI goes horribly wrong, in both outcome and process." 
* 'The Research' - a high level summary the actual thing that happened 
* 'The Coverage' - a summary of how the research was portrayed in media 
* 'The Criticism' - a summary of how coverage was good/bad, as well as links to others' criticism 
* 'The Gist' - basically restating the intro but with more specificity 

## Workflow 
Because we are all busy people, the hope is to have multiple collaborators writing posts in their free time. Because each post is short but accurate/includes links to outside sources/requires research, they will typically take 5-15 hours to write. The hope is to have each collaborator write a post every 2-4 weeks. I (Andrey) will serve as editor and occasional writer, as well as the owner of the repo. Initial drafts should be shared via draftin.com , where I and others can help with editing. Then, the story can be added to the main site via a pull request to the main repo (https://github.com/andreykurenkov/skynet-today). Each collaborator will be credited as the author of whatever they wrote. 

 
## General Notes 
Generally go with a *very* light touch when criticizing research / research orgs. They are part of the target audience. Dump the negativity on media (and Elon Musk)
