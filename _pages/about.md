## What is this
As it says up there, this is a site dedicated to providing sane, informed written criticism of the latest AI hype and doomsaying. To expand on that a bit, the idea is to post a comprehensive overview of each major AI story that bubbles up in popular media. This has happened more and more as the AI hype wave has gone on, to the point where it seems something like this needs to exist.

## Who are you
I am [Andrey Kurenkov](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/about/), currently a graduate student at Stanford who has studied and is doing research in AI. I also [blog](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/) about miscallenous topics and have [written](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning/) [several](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/a-brief-history-of-game-ai/) long-form 

## Why are you doing this
Why not? Depending on how cynical you are, you may believe this is me altruisticaly attempting to dispell at least some of the rising tide of misinformation on this topic, or you may believe this is me weirdly but blatantly trying to increase my own profile as person working in AI; of course neither belief is completely false, but at least I'd like to believe it's more the former than the latter. 

## But surely you are aware AI is an existential threat
Yes yes, I am quite aware of the [existential threat](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html),
