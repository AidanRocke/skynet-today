## What is this
As it says up there, this is a site dedicated to providing accessible and informed written criticism of the latest AI hype and panic. In other words, the idea is to post a concise but comprehensive overview of each major AI story that bubbles up in popular media. Such stories have happened more and more as the AI hype wave has gone on, to the point where it seems something like this needs to exist. 

## Who are you
We are a group of people with education in Computer Science and various levels of domain knowledge in AI. The chief editor and creator of the publication is [Andrey Kurenkov](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/), who is a graduate student at Stanford and doing research in AI and has [written](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning/) [several](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-game-ai/) long-form explanatory pieces about AI in the past. 

## Why are you doing this
We work on this effort in our spare time, purely out of the belief that those with knowledge of how AI really works need to provide that sane and informed perspective to everyone else.

## But surely you are aware AI is an existential threat
Yes, we are quite aware of the [existential threat](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) story. The counterpoint to that is wonderfully conveyed by [Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai/); an AGI or even scary doom AI is certainly possible, but we still seem far from it. This site's focus will be on providing perspective on stories in the here and now, not hypotheticals about the future.
