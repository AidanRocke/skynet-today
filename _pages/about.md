## What is this

As it says up there, this is a site dedicated to providing sane, informed written criticism of the latest AI hype and doomsaying. To expand on that a bit, the idea is to post a comprehensive overview of each major AI story that bubbles up in popular media. This has happened more and more as the AI hype wave has gone on, to the point where it seems something like this needs to exist.

## Who are you
I am [Andrey Kurenkov](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/about/), currently a graduate student at Stanford who has studied and is doing research in AI. I also [blog](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/) (or used to, when I had time) about miscallenous topics and have [written](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning/) [several](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/a-brief-history-of-game-ai/) long-form explainer-thingies about AI for my own education and for fun.

## Why are you doing this
Why not? It's a fun side project, and something like this should frankly already exist. I am also as busy as any grad student, so if you would like to collaborate and assist with this effort get in touch!

## But surely you are aware AI is an existential threat
Yes yes, I am quite aware of the [existential threat](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) story. My take on it is wonderfully conveyed by [Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai/); an AGI or even scary doom AI is certainly possible, but we still seem far from it. It's easy to predict never-ending exponential improvements in technolgoy leading to a strong AI, but as Brooks argues there is no reason to assume continued exponential returns in compute power, research progress, quality of brain simulation, or any of the above.
