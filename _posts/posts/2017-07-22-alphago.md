Not a particularly big story, but an early one to impress me with the sorts of misrepresentations of AI research that can crop up in media these days. Thus, the first one to be covered here!

## The Research

["Why the Final Game Between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol Is Such a Big Deal for Humanity"](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/final-game-alphago-lee-sedol-big-deal-humanity/)
["Why is Google's Go win such a big deal?"](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/9/11185030/google-deepmind-alphago-go-artificial-intelligence-impact)
["This Is Why A Computer Winning At Go Is Such A Big Deal"](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tomchivers/im-sorry-dave-im-afraid-i-cant-do-that?utm_term=.hjVv0xkE6#.dsB0bL58P)
