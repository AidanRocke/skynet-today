Not a particularly big story, but an early one to impress me with the sorts of misrepresentations of AI research that can crop up in media these days. Thus, the first one to be covered here!

## The Research
OpenAI's own blog posts summarizes it nicely with ["We’ve developed an unsupervised system which learns an excellent representation of sentiment, despite being trained only to predict the next character in the text of Amazon reviews"](https://blog.openai.com/unsupervised-sentiment-neuron/). In other words, they (A) learned a representation of text through training a next-character prediction model in an unsupervised fashion (without needing any other data beyond the text itself) and (B) showed that this representation captures sentiment well because it can be used for supervised training of state of the art models for sentiment classifiction (trained on some text labeled as either negative or positive, the model can classify any text as being negative or positive). This is a good result, though it should be noted that representation learning is a common use of unsupervised learning and the approach of pretraining a model on a lot of data (82 million Amazon reviews in this case) followed by supervised learning on less data is not at all novel. 

## The Media
Most egregiously, there was coverage that claimed that ["An AI backed by Elon Musk just ‘evolved’ to learn by itself"](http://www.globalfuturist.org/2017/04/an-ai-backed-by-elon-musk-just-evolved-to-learn-by-itself/). The headline is more dramatic More reasonable coverage covered it as ["AI Learns to Read Sentiment Without Being Trained to Do So"](https://futurism.com/ai-learns-to-read-sentiment-without-being-trained-to-do-so/) and ["Unsupervised AI Trains Itself How To Analyze Sentiment"](http://techthelead.com/unsupervised-ai-trains-analyze-sentiment/).
