Skynet Today is seeking collaborators and editorial submissions! AI misinformation, overhyping, and doomsaying
are more rampant than ever and our small motley team could sure benefit from a few 
more excited and knowledgeable collaborators and contributors. 

## Collaborators
First, let's explain that 'collaborators' bit. It is typical for publications to have a
'Call for Submissions', but as this is basically a non-monetized open source project we are also
seeking to help grow the core team of more involved collaborators like any open source project does: 
asking for people in the community to join if interested.

Why the need for a larger core team? Since this site's mission is to cover **the latest** AI hype and panic, 
it needs to continuously cover recent media stories about AI. We hope to accomplish this by having a small group 
of dedicated people who commit to continuously writing such news coverage. The format and length of the current 
coverage is specifically tailored to making this reasonable for people to do in their free time, but it is 
still a non-trivial commitment.
