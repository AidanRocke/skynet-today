These are just a small selection of now old headlines from when AI hype was starting to reach the fever pitch condition it has now attained. Way back when these headlines were published - late 2016 - I got the idea to tackle this tendency in media coverage with a blog post titled "AI Headlines These Days Are Wildly Innacurate - So I Corrected Some". But, I quickly realized the flood of misinformation was too large and one blog post would do nothing to quell it. So, I set the idea aside. 

A year passed, nothing changed; maybe things got worse. Far more absurd headlines such as ["An AI backed by Elon Musk just ‘evolved’ to learn by itself"](http://www.globalfuturist.org/2017/04/an-ai-backed-by-elon-musk-just-evolved-to-learn-by-itself/) and ["Facebook AI Invents Language That Humans Can't Understand: System Shut Down Before It Evolves Into Skynet"](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/212124/20170730/facebook-ai-invents-language-that-humans-cant-understand-system-shut-down-before-it-evolves-into-skynet.html) routinely start showing up in my recommended articles on Fliboard. This feeds on my ever growing sense of cynicism and dampens my excitement for being a researcher in this field. And then I get an impromptu idea:

Newletters like [This Week In Wild AI](http://www.wildml.com/newsletter/) and [Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/)  do a fantastic job of accurately promoting exciting developments in the field, but no such regular coverage attempts to deflate the increasingly sensationalist and often downright misleading coverage found in wider-reaching news sites. Sites such as Wired and The Verge do a good job of deflating silly stories every once in a while, but it seemed something akin to an  AI-specific [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/) (a fact checking site for trending stories) was called for. Being the busy grad student that I am it took me a little while to get to working on this project, but work on it I did!

And now it is 2018... and I am trying to really make this a real thing by moving beyond the few practice posts into ongoing coverage of the latest big AI stories. With that being the case, it seems like a good time to enumerate the broad principles and beliefs this site will promote. 

* "AI" does not do things - people do. Period. Obviously, headlines and often articles themselves want to describe things in ways that are familiar to us from science fiction - so, AI is presented as some sort of sentient machine intelligence that is let loose by us humans and then does crazy stuff. Except, that's basically never accurate in the present day. In the present day, AI should only be used to the large field of diverse research aiming to solve complex problems that computers suck at and humans are good at[^AI].
* Machine Learning results in the present are exclusively very specialized AI results. As [President Obama](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/) correctly summarized, the state of the art still amounts to very good but very specizlied problem solvers. So, we get neural nets that can translate languages, identify objects, and perform navigations for driving - but not something as complex as cutting together a trailer. (cite 
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609048/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-ai-predictions/ "3. Performance versus competence" Alphago)
* We have no idea about whether "Strong AI" is even possible, much less how likely it is to develop. As Rodney Brooks states "Nothing in the universe is without limit." Extrapolation is often stupid (eg the facebook language thing). 
* Most academic research is stricly incremental, and builds on years and decades of prior work. Acknowleding this matters.
* The impacts of AI in society will be dramatic and unprecedented, but will most likely not be the same as popular science fiction. The very title 'Skynet Today' is meant to be tongue in cheek.
(more???)

So, these are the core beliefs contributors to this site will promote. Beyond that, the mission is really this simple: "Sane, informed criticism of the latest AI hype and doomsaying".
