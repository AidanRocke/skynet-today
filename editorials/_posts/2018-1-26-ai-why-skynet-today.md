-"AI" does not do things - people do. Period. Obviously, headlines and often actual article content wants to present things in ways that are familiar to us from science fiction - so, AI is some sort of machine intelligence that is let loose by us humans and then does crazy stuff. Except, that's basically never accurate in the present day. In the present day, AI should only be used to the large field of diverse research aiming to solve complex problems that computers suck at and humans are good at[^AI].
-Machine Learning results in the present are exclusively very specialized AI results. As [President Obama](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/) correctly summarized recently, the state of the art still amounts to very good but very specizlied problem solvers. So, we get neural nets that can translate languages, identify objects, and perform navigations for driving - but not something as complex as cutting together a trailer. 

[^Google]: Sure, this is techy and a bit jargon-y - but then this is a report on research! If media is now eager to report on cutting-edge AI research, it should 
[^IBM]: This one is very annoying, and so obviously just a marketing ploy by IBM. Still, many online publications went with IBM's wildly innacurate characterization regardless - because hey, it sounds cool right? 
[^crypto]: The actual article here is impressively in depth and accurate, and makes no such claims.
